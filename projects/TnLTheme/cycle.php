									</a>
								</div>
								<div id="collapse11" class="accordion-body collapse">
									<div class="accordion-inner">
										<div class="answer">Answer:</div>
										<p>This depends on how you structure this stage of your lesson. It is important that students are individually accountable and there is active engagement in any activity. Students show progress through the work they produce, the discussions they have with their team, shoulder/face partner or any questioning from the teacher.</p>

								<div id="collapse12" class="accordion-body collapse">
									<div class="accordion-inner">
										<div class="answer">Answer:</div>
										<p>We must remember that good learning is about planning a learning lesson not a busy lesson. As teachers we are the experts in our subject and with the different groups we teach. We need to plan activities which will enable students to achieve their learning objective and make progress.</p>

								</div>
								<div id="collapse13" class="accordion-body collapse">
									<div class="accordion-inner">
										<div class="answer">Answer:</div>
										<p>This is vital for us to share good practice and develop effective learning classrooms. However this is not always possible due to the time constraints upon us. Using the VLE will allow us more flexibility and opportunity for collaboration without having to sit directly side by side with someone.</p>

								<div id="collapse14" class="accordion-body collapse">
									<div class="accordion-inner">
										<div class="answer">Answer:</div>
										<p>Assessment to support learning will be evident at each stage of the cyle. This will occur through our learning objectives and success criteria/progress steps, feedback we give, questions we ask, peer or self assessment tasks, reviews (these can happen all the way through a lesson)</p>

									</a>
								</div>
								<div id="collapse16" class="accordion-body collapse">
									<div class="accordion-inner">
										<div class="answer">Answer:</div>
										<p>No. Initially it may take a while to familiarise yourself with each stage of the cycle and working in teams within your departments will help support this. Once familiar with the cycle the process of planning lessons will speed up. The crucial thing is not to sit by yourself and try to re-invent the wheel.</p>

									<div class="accordion-inner">
										<div class="answer">Answer:</div>
										<p>Success criteria can be discussed with students where you feel it is appropriate for learning. This may be at the same time as learning objectives, students may be involved in writing their own or you may choose to highlight each of the criteria. Please write/hyperlink success criteria or your progress steps on your learning plan in the box titled learning objectives.</p>

										<p>Walbottle Learning Cycle provides structure to our lesson planning and delivery. Active listening is a communication technique that can be used by a member of staff where they feel relevant at any stage within the cycle.</p>

										<p>As an LSA you will not be expected to plan lessons, your role is to support students and teachers in the learning process. The more knowledge and understanding you have of how good learning is structured the more effective your support will be.</p>

								</div>
								<div id="collapse22" class="accordion-body collapse">
									<div class="accordion-inner">
										<div class="answer">Answer:</div>
										<p>Walbottle Learning Cycle provides structure to our planning for learning. Nothing changes for the students other than we may use the names of the different stages i.e. connect the learning. Students will be introduced to the cycle in assemblies in the first week back after October half term. The aim of this is to brief them on what they can expect from lessons and make them aware that we will work with student voice to find out their views on the cycle.</p>

								<div id="collapse24" class="accordion-body collapse">
									<div class="accordion-inner">
										<div class="answer">Answer:</div>
										<p>The amount of activities used depends entirely on the learning that takes place or is planned to take place. This will be specific to the group and content that you deliver therefore no set number can be placed on this.</p>

									</a>
								</div>
								<div id="collapse25" class="accordion-body collapse">
									<div class="accordion-inner">
										<div class="answer">Answer:</div>
										<p>Co-operative learning are structures that can be used to deliver any aspect and can therefore fit into any stage of the cycle due to the nature that structures are not content driven. For example, using stand up hand up pair up, depending on the question you set will determine whether this is for example connecting the learning or reviewing.</p>

									</a>
								</div>
								<div id="collapse31" class="accordion-body collapse">
									<div class="accordion-inner">
										<div class="answer">Answer:</div>
										<p>When demonstrating new understanding students should be encouraged, as an example, to present their new understanding to each other, the class or the teacher. This stage is about students applying their new understanding in new contexts. Review and reflect is where students consolidate and reflect on the learning that took place. This shouldn’t always be content based and students may review the skills they have developed or the process they went through. Students can consider the learning objectives and success criteria.</p>
