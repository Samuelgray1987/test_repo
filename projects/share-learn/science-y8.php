				<h4><a href="lf.php">Light Fantastic</a></h4>
				<p>Light is a type of energy. It is a form of electromagnetic radiation of a wavelength which can be detected by the human eye. It is a small part of the electromagnetic spectrum and radiation given off by stars like the Sun. Light exists in tiny packets called photons. It shows properties of both waves and particles. The study of light, known as optics, is an important research area in modern physics.</p>

				<h4><a href="ete.php">Explaining The Earth</a></h4>
				<p>The Earth is the third planet from the Sun and it is the only planet known to have life on it. The Earth formed around 4.5 billion years ago. It is one of four rocky planets on the inside of the Solar System. The science of the study of the Earth is known as Geology.</p>

				<h4><a href="fgf.php">Food Glorious Food</a></h4>
				<p>Food is any substance consumed to provide nutritional support for the body. It is usually of plant or animal origin, and contains essential nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, or minerals. The substance is ingested by an organism and assimilated by the organism's cells in an effort to produce energy, maintain life, or stimulate growth.</p>

				<h4><a href="dand.php">Doctors And Disease</a></h4>
				<p>A disease or medical condition is a weird occurrence of the body or mind that causes pain, discomfort, distress, or death to the person who has the disease. The term is sometimes used broadly to include injuries, disabilities, disorders, syndromes, infections, symptoms, deviant behaviors, and atypical variations of structure and function, while in other contexts these may be considered separate categories.</p>

				<h4><a href="gfg.php">Going for Gold</a></h4>
				<p>Gold is a soft, heavy, shiny metal. It has been used for many thousands of years by people all over the world, for jewelry, decoration, and as money. Gold was important because it was rare, but also easier to use than other rare metals. It is also used to repair teeth and in electronic equipment such as computers.</p>

				<h4><a href="ht.php">Heat Transfers</a></h4>
				<p>Heat is a form of energy. In thermodynamics, heat means energy which is moved between two things when one of them is hotter than the other. Heat is a central concept in thermodynamics and statistical mechanics, and is also important in chemistry, engineering, and other disciplines.</p>

				<h4><a href="itd.php">In the Drink</a></h4>
				<p>A liquid is a form of matter. It is settled between solid and gas. Liquid has an almost-fixed volume, but no set shape. Every small force makes a liquid change its shape by flowing. Because of that, gravity makes liquids always take the shape of the container. The molecules that make up the liquid can freely move among themselves.</p>

				<h4><a href="mar.php">Materials and Recycling</a></h4>
				<p>Recycling means turning the materials from waste into something new. Glass, paper, plastic, and metals such as aluminum and steel are all commonly recycled. Dead plants, fruit and vegetable scraps can be recycled through composting. It is important, however, not to confuse recycling with reusing, which is where old things, such as clothes, are donated or given a new use instead of being thrown out.</p>

				<h4><a href="otm.php">On the Move</a></h4>
				<p>Movement, or motion, is the state of changing something's position - that is, changing where something is. A flying bird or a walking person are moving, because they change where they are from one place to another. There are many kinds of science and math related to movement.</p>

				<h4><a href="atg.php">All that Glitters</a></h4>
				<p>In chemistry, metal is a word for a group of chemical elements that have certain properties. It is easy for the atoms of a metal to lose an electron and become positive ions, or cations. In this way, metals are not like the other two kinds of elements - the nonmetals and the metalloids.</p>

				<h4><a href="sah.php">Sound and Hearing</a></h4>
				<p>We can define a sound wave as a disturbance which travels through some medium. Sound is the term to describe what is heard when sound waves pass through a medium to the ear. Sound waves move away from their source (where they came from), traveling on the air molecules. When the vibrating air molecules reach our ears, the eardrum vibrates, too. These vibrations let you hear different sounds.</p>

				<h4><a href="twotd.php">The Way of the Dodo</a></h4>
				<p>Extinction is one of the major features of evolution. A species is extinct when no members of the species are still alive. All species become extinct sooner or later. The end of a species may happen for many reasons. It may be caused by habitat loss or by being overhunted, or by a major extinction event. An example of an animal that is now extinct is the Dodo, from over-hunting</p>
